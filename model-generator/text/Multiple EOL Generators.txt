It is possible to include multiple EOL programs in the generator.
This can be achived by including multiple EOL Generator objects into one instance. Each one with a different EOL Program.
The order in which the generators are added, will dictate the priority of the operations. This means that if multiple programs implement the same operation on the same type/context, then the operation that was added first will be execited.
